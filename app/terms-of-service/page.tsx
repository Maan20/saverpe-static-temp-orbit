      <p>Orbit provides businesses with information about, and quotes for, bulk digital gift cards issued by third-party brands and their authorised program managers.

        <li>Validity, redemption channels, partial redemption, and restrictions are determined by the issuing brand.</li>
        <li>Gift cards cannot be exchanged for cash, refunded or cancelled once issued, unless the brand&apos;s terms or applicable law state otherwise.</li>
        <li>Lost, stolen or shared codes are the responsibility of the holder. Treat gift card codes like cash.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Accuracy of information</h2>
      <p>We work to keep brand information, denominations and terms accurate, but brands may change their programs without notice. In case of conflict, the brand&apos;s current terms prevail.</p>
      <h2>4. Intellectual property</h2>
